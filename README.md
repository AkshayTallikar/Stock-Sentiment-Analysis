# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis
trains on news headlines of from kaggle dataset and then predicts if the review is postive or negative.
Can be applied to news headlines from different websites
Needs improvement on accuracy>
You can either use Textblob or the trained clf model to classify the sentiment in Stock-Sentiment-analysis(V5).ipynb>
If you get an error when trying to add colums for the NLTK textblob classification, open the csv file and add 'sentence' to the first line. 
All the other errors should be fixed.
Happy investing:)
